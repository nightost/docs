# mixin
## Hook functions with the same name are merged into an array so that all of them will be called. Mixin hooks will be called before the componentâ€™s own hooks.
```vue
var mixin = {
  created: function () {
    console.log('mixin hook called')
  }
}

new Vue({
  mixins: [mixin],
  created: function () {
    console.log('component hook called')
  }
})

// => "mixin hook called"
// => "component hook called"
```
